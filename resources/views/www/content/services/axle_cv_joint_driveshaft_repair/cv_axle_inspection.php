    'desc' => 'The CV axle is a drive axle located between the drive wheels. Its role is to deliver consistent power to the wheels as they traverse various types of terrain. The CV axle is attached to the wheels by CV joints. The inner CV joints connect the transmission to the CV axle while the outer CV joints connect the CV axle to the wheels. The CV joints connect the CV axle to the wheels, and deliver power while maintaining a constant velocity. The CV axle assembly—the axle shaft, CV joints, and CV boots—is designed to deliver flexible power to the wheels. This means that the axle is able to transmit required levels of torque to the wheels regardless of the angle of the axle. At first, CV axles were commonly used in front-wheel drive vehicles, but today CV axles are also common in rear-wheel drive vehicles.'
