    'desc' => 'CV axles were once primarily used on front-wheel drive vehicles. Today, CV axles are common on both front-wheel and rear-wheel drive vehicles. The CV axle assembly—the axle shaft, CV joints, and CV boots—is designed to flexibly deliver power to the wheels for a seamless transfer of torque. Located between the drive wheels, the CV axle, along with the suspension system, compensates for irregularities in the road and transmits torque to the wheels while keeping them turning at a constant velocity. The CV axle is attached to the wheels by CV joints. The inner CV joints connect the transmission to the CV axle while the outer CV joints connect the CV axle to the wheels. A fully functional CV axle assembly provides your vehicle with safety and stability while supporting passenger comfort through various speeds and driving conditions.',
