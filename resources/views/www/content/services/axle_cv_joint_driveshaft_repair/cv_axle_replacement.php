            'desc' => 'CV axles were once primarily used on front-wheel drive vehicles. Today, CV axles are common on both front-wheel and rear-wheel drive vehicles. The CV axle assembly—the axle shaft, CV joints, and CV boots—is designed to flexibly deliver power to the wheels for a seamless transfer of torque. Located between the drive wheels, the CV axle, along with the suspension system, compensates for irregularities in the road and transmits torque to the wheels while keeping them turning at a constant velocity. The CV axle is attached to the wheels by CV joints. The inner CV joints connect the transmission to the CV axle while the outer CV joints connect the CV axle to the wheels. A fully functional CV axle assembly provides your vehicle with safety and stability while supporting passenger comfort through various speeds and driving conditions.',

            'desc' => 'The CV axle assembly will wear out over time due to the nature of its flexibility and the extreme conditions endured by its components. If the wheels on your car or truck hesitate or you feel resistance while turning, your CV axle may have problems. Sudden pops while turning indicate that your CV axle may need a replacement. When looking for signs that your CV axle needs to be replaced, keep in mind that many symptoms can point to other issues like unaligned wheels or uneven tread wear. Maintaining and replacing other components in your vehicle’s CV axle assembly will keep your entire assembly working as intended and help prevent CV axle replacements. Driving with a damaged CV axle will only worsen other components and lead to more expensive repairs down the road. At the first sign of trouble, contact us for a CV axle replacement service.',
