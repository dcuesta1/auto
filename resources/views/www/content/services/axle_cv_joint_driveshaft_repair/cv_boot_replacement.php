    'desc' => 'CV joints connect the transmission to the wheels and are an important part of your vehicleâ€™s drive axles. Each drive axle has two CV joints. The inner CV joint connects the transmission to the axle, and the outer joint connects the axle to the wheels. As the vehicle experiences road force, the CV joints move in conjunction with the suspension system while helping the wheels maintain a constant velocity. A CV boot houses a CV joint and protects it by keeping out dirt, debris, and other elements. CV boots are made of rubber or plastic strong enough to withstand the constant bending of the CV joints. The boots also ensure that the CV joints remain lubricated by encapsulating the required amount of lithium moly grease. Without proper lubrication, a CV joint cannot easily adjust to the motion of the wheels. CV boots naturally degrade with age. Inspections can prolong the life of CV joints and prevent costly future repairs or replacements.',
