The inner CV joint connects the transmission to the axle, and the outer joint connects the axle to the wheels. Because the CV joint links two rotating shafts in a fixed position, it must allow for a range of motion to compensate for road force while keeping the two shafts connected. The CV joint is responsible for transmitting consistent torque to the wheels regardless of the angle of the axle or shaft. The CV joints move with the suspension system to help the wheels maintain a constant velocity through various road forces like bumps and potholes. The CV joint is designed like a ball and socket joint and uses steel balls to move a larger ball enclosed by steel. A CV boot covers the CV joint and helps ensure proper lubrication. CV joints allow for a range of motion while keeping your vehicle’s wheels moving at the same speeds over all types of surfaces.'
