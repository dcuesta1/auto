    'desc' => 'Your vehicle’s axle, CV joint, and driveshaft components are integral to the performance and drivability of your vehicle. The driveshaft is a steel or aluminum cylindrical component that connects the transmission to the rear differential. The driveshaft connects to the transmission through the CV joints, which are responsible for transferring the torque from the transmission to the drive wheels at a constant speed. Front wheel drive vehicles use CV joints on the front axles. CV joints allow the axle to bend and change while accommodating the bounce of the wheels. The axle bears the weight of the vehicle while also being strong enough to sustain the forces from braking and accelerating. Over time and through normal use, your vehicle’s axle, CV joint, and driveshaft components may require maintenance or replacement services.',
