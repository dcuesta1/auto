            'desc' => 'Heater hoses play a crucial role in a vehicle’s heating system, which operates in conjunction with the cooling system. Running engines produce a tremendous amount of heat that will need to be transferred away from the engine in order to prevent overheating and subsequent breakdowns. Heater hoses are responsible for carrying coolant to prevent overheating. Coolant or antifreeze flows through the engine, absorbs the excess heat, and carries the heat away from the engine. More specifically, heater hoses are responsible for transferring coolant away from the engine to the heater core, where the warm air can be blown inside the compartment of your vehicle by engaging the adjacent fan. Heater fans blow through the heater core to heat the vehicle and cool the antifreeze inside of it. The hoses transfer the coolant back into the path of the cooling system at a lower temperature so the coolant can continue to regulate consistent temperatures inside the engine.'

            'desc' => 'Made of durable rubber, heater hoses are built to sustain the hot coolant that is carried from the engine to the heater core. Poor climate control is a sign of problems with your vehicle’s hoses. When your heater hoses near the end of their useful life, they will become hard and brittle or soft and mushy. If they crack, the coolant will leak and pool underneath your vehicle. When this happens, allow a member of our service staff to replace your heater hoses. A leaky hose means your heating system will not effectively heat your vehicle, and your cooling system will not have a proper supply of coolant. Leaky heater hoses can result in your engine overheating. As such, we encourage you to periodically inspect your heater hoses to determine the correct time to replace them.'
