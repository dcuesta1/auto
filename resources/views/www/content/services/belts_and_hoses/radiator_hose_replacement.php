            'desc' => 'Your car or truck’s radiator hoses, which connect the engine to the radiator, are important components that maintain consistent internal engine temperatures. The upper hose connects to the top of the engine, while the lower hose connects to the bottom. Coolant flows through the engine to cool internal temperatures and works with the hoses. Radiator hoses carry hot coolant away from the engine and into the radiator, a large tank with small channels where the coolant flows to dissipate heat. Radiator fans, which are located behind the radiator, help cool the antifreeze or coolant once it enters. The radiator hoses also carry the coolant back into the engine to absorb the heat created during the combustion process. Once the engine reaches operating temperatures, the hot coolant cycles back to the radiator where it is cooled again. Because the engine can reach extreme temperatures, the coolant is often extremely hot. Over time, hot coolant can cause radiator hoses to deteriorate from the inside out.'

            'desc' => 'Replacing your radiator hoses is one way to minimize the chance of engine failure and breakdowns. A visual inspection of your hoses can help you determine the proper time to replace them. Cracks, bulges, and hardened hoses are all signs that your radiator hoses are nearing the end of their useful life. Poor heating system performance also indicates a problem with your hoses. Heat, vibrations, and corrosion are all contributing factors to bad radiator hoses. A coolant leak in either green, red, or yellow liquid is another warning sign of a cracked or corroded radiator hose that should be replaced. Bad hoses can cause serious engine damage through an overheating engine or catastrophic failure. At the first sign of a bad radiator hose, be sure to contact our service staff to have your radiator hose replaced.'
