            'desc' => 'As the timing belt synchronizes engine processes, the serpentine belt powers peripheral processes in the engine compartment, like the power steering pump, water pump, cooling fan, air conditioner, and alternator. The serpentine belt receives its name from the snake-like path it takes through the various steering and electrical components it powers. Belt tension also plays an important role in serpentine belt maintenance. A properly tensioned belt helps promote long belt life while ensuring that all components are not overloaded or strained during operation. Serpentine belts are tough, built to sustain years of continued and heavy use, but they do have a natural life projected by every manufacturer. Periodic inspections of your serpentine belt will help prevent breakdowns, though replacing your serpentine belt is a natural part of overall car maintenance. If you suspect trouble with your serpentine belt, please give us a call or contact us for assistance.'

            'desc' => 'Because your serpentine belt powers varying processes in the front of your engine, failure of the belt will result in failure of the other processes. If the serpentine belt fails to power the water pump, an important part of the cooling system, your engine could overheat and break down. Steering would also be impossible without a fully functioning belt. Regular inspections can keep your serpentine belt operating as intended. Visual inspections are the best way to detect early signs of serpentine belt issues, like frays and cracks. Trouble turning or steering at low speeds is another sign of possible belt failure. A loose belt can result in overheating, engine noise, or a dead battery. Manufacturers advise adhering to specific maintenance intervals for scheduling a serpentine belt replacement. When itâ€™s time to replace your serpentine belt, just give us a call or contact us online.'
