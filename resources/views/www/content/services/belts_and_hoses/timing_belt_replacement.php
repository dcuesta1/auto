            'desc' => 'The timing belt, or timing chain in some vehicles, is a drive belt that synchronizes the rotation of the engine’s crankshaft and camshaft with the opening and closing of your engine’s valves. Depending on the vehicle, it may also rotate the water pump. When the crankshaft turns, the timing belt turns the camshaft, which opens and closes the engine valves to allow the pistons to move up and down. Your vehicle’s engine operates in four phases: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. During the intake phase, intake valves open and exhaust valves close as fuel and air enter the cylinders. As the air and fuel is mixed, compressed, and ignited by spark plugs during the compression and combustion phases, the valves close. The remaining air and fuel is pushed out of the exhaust valve during the exhaust phase. The timing belt is responsible for synchronizing this process and for opening and closing valves during normal engine operation.'

            'desc' => 'Avoiding a timing belt replacement can result in complete engine failure. A worn or stretched belt can disrupt the operating order of the valves and pistons, which can result in a piston hitting a valve and damaging the engine. Timing belt failure warning signs include rough idling or difficulty starting the engine. Cracks on the belt, which is made of reinforced rubber, are an indication that it may soon break. Replacement of your timing belt will help keep your engine performing as it should and ensure you avoid expensive future repairs. During our replacement service, your belt will be replaced and synchronized with the crankshaft and camshaft to restore proper operating precision and order. It is widely recommended that you have your water pump changed during a timing belt replacement service as well. If your water pump fails later, it can do great damage to your vehicle. Since the water pump is easy to change during a timing belt replacement, consider having a new one installed at this time. Referring to your owner’s manual will help determine the appropriate service intervals for timing belt maintenance.'
