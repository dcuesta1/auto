            'desc' => 'Brakes use friction to bring a vehicle to a complete stop. This friction creates a substantial amount of heat that can degrade the brakes and brake components over time. As a result, inspecting these components and ensuring proper operation has become a critical part of overall vehicle maintenance. Although brake systems vary from vehicle to vehicle, the responsibility and importance of the components remains the same. Today, some common brake types include drum and disc brakes. Drum brakes contain brake shoes, drums, wheel cylinders, springs, and self-adjusters. Disc brakes contain brake pads, rotors, calipers, and hydraulic components. Depending on the design of the rear brake system, the parking brake assembly, which keeps the vehicle from rolling once stopped, can be housed in either a drum or rotor. All of these components, including the brake pedal and brake fluid, should be checked during a brake inspection service to help ensure that a vehicle is safe to operate.'

            'desc' => 'Brake inspections are crucial to ensuring safe driving conditions. Determining when to seek an inspection will depend on your driving conditions and preferences. The goal of our brake inspection is to find, diagnose, and discuss any issues while recommending brake repair procedures. During a brake inspection, we may discover that your brake system requires new brake pads or shoes, or the installation of new brake calipers or wheel cylinders. Alternatively, we may need to drain and replace your old brake fluid to rid the brake lines of air, dirt, and other contaminants. If your brake lines and hoses show cracks or heat damage, we may suggest replacements. To restore maximum braking ability, the rotors or drums of your disc or drum brake system might also need to be replaced. Our methods and items for repair will vary by inspection, so please contact us online or give us a call to learn more about brake maintenance.'
