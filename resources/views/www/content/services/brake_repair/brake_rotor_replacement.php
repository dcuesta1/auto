            'desc' => 'Your brake system’s rotors, in conjunction with the brake pads, help bring your vehicle to a complete stop. Commonly made of cast iron, rotors are discs that mount to the wheel hub. When you press the brake pedal, the brake pads compress against the rotors and slow your wheels. Rotor design may vary from vehicle to vehicle and from brake system to brake system. Variations in design help dissipate the heat created between the brake pads and the rotors when you slow your vehicle. Disc brake systems can account for heat dissipation in two ways: either the rotors will have a ventilated design, or the brake pads will contain a slot on the surface. These vents and slots provide passages so air circulation can effectively cool the rotor. Proper heat dissipation is extremely important for prolonging the life of your rotors. Drivers are encouraged to watch their brake rotors and seek rotor repairs or rotor replacements when necessary.'

            'desc' => 'Brake pads and rotors work together to stop your vehicle, and share similar wear patterns. As brake pads compress against the rotor to stop the vehicle, the friction required to slow your wheels creates a large amount of heat that, if not properly dissipated, can wear down your brake pads and rotors. A vibrating brake pedal is one indication that your rotors are damaged and need to be replaced. When a rotor is removed from the brake assembly, the rotor will be inspected for cracks and other damage incurred during routine operation. Periodic inspections of rotors will prolong rotor repairs and replacements while ensuring your brake system continues operating as expected. Seeking brake rotor replacements within the service intervals indicated by your owner’s manual, or as wear and tear dictates, is an important part of brake maintenance. If you are wondering if a rotor replacement is right for your vehicle, please consult with a member of our service staff today.'
