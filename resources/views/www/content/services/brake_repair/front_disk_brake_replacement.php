            'desc' => 'In the brake systems of modern vehicles, disc brakes are used in both the front and rear of the vehicle. Front disc brake systems contain brake pads, calipers, rotors, and hydraulic components. In a disc brake system, the rotor is mounted to the wheel hub, and calipers are responsible for squeezing the brake pads against the disc in order to slow the speed of the turning rotor and bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Because front disc brake systems convert kinetic energy into heat, ventilation slots, holes, or vanes are necessary for expelling heat from the brake system. While the brake pads are already designed to withstand heat, excessive amounts of heat are still damaging to the pads as well as other disc brake components. Brake systems that use disc brakes are known to possess strong stopping power. Like all brake systems, however, disc brakes will wear over time. This is why routine maintenance is extremely important.'

            'desc' => 'Because front brakes provide most of your vehicle’s stopping power, they tend to wear out more quickly than rear brakes. When deciding whether or not to schedule a front disc brake repair service, there are some symptoms to consider. Squealing noises from the front brakes point to worn brake pads, while grinding noises are a sure sign that your rotors need servicing. If your brake pedal shakes when engaged, this may also be a sign of bad rotors. A vehicle that pulls to one side when braking indicates a bad caliper or uneven brake pad wear, which can result from uneven distribution of pressure in the brake lines. Besides incurring additional repair costs, leaving symptoms of an impending front disc brake repair untreated can lead to serious, stressful situations for both yourself and other drivers on the road.'
