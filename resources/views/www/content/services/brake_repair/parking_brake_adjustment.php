The parking brake, also known as the emergency brake, is applied independently of regular brakes and is engaged by either pulling the parking brake lever or pressing a special pedal. Most motorists use the parking brake when parking on a steep hill. However, the parking brake can also be used to stop suddenly and prevent an accident from occurring. There are three types of parking brakes that use a ratchet locking mechanism: stick, center level, and pedal. Each type of parking brake depends on the style of driver’s seat, and each operates differently depending on the brake system. You should always consult the owner’s manual to determine the correct position of a disengaged parking brake and whether or not your parking brake needs an adjustment.'

            'desc' => 'A properly functioning parking brake is critical for your safety and the safety of your passengers. At some point in the life of your brake system, it may be necessary to adjust the parking brake for a few reasons. Parking brakes use cables to transmit lever movement, and these cables stretch through use and as they age. A properly tensioned cable is an important part of firmly engaging a parking brake. A parking brake that no longer grips as it once did or sticks is another reason to seek a parking brake adjustment. Solutions to some parking brake problems may be found in the replacement of parts or additional lubrication to moving components. Our staff will determine the correct parking brake repair or adjustment procedure upon inspecting your parking brake and accompanying components.'
