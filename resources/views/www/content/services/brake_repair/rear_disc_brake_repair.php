            'desc' => 'Some brake systems use disc brakes in the rear of a vehicle. Most rear disc brake systems contain brake pads, calipers, rotors, and a parking brake assembly. Calipers are responsible for squeezing the brake pads against the rotor, which is mounted to the wheel hub. When you apply pressure to the brakes, the brake pads are hydraulically pressed against the brake disc to create the necessary amount of friction for slowing the turning rotor. A rear disc brake system converts kinetic energy into heat. Most brake rotors incorporate a ventilated design to release heat from the brake system. When the parking brake is applied, a piston is pushed into the brake pad to keep the vehicle from moving. In some systems, a “drum in hat” parking brake assembly uses parking brake shoes to keep the vehicle from moving. Brake systems with rear disc brakes are known to possess strong stopping power in even the worst driving conditions. However, they are still susceptible to the same type of wear and tear as any regularly used brake system.'

            'desc' => 'Braking naturally creates a substantial amount of heat and friction, so rear disc brakes will wear from natural use. Routine rear disc brake inspections can prevent excessive wear from damaging other brake components like calipers and rotors. Completely worn brake pads can cause calipers to squeeze metal on metal, which will damage the rotors. Some disc brake pads have a wear indicator strip that makes a whistling sound to notify you when brake pads need replacements. Sometimes the calipers can stick and keep from retracting all the way, which can cause quicker wear on brake pads. Squealing and grinding noises are the first sign of disc brake issues, but be sure to seek a rear brake repair service for your disc brakes at the first sign of any trouble. Properly working disc brakes are important for your safety and the safety of other drivers on the road.'
