            'desc' => 'Some brake systems use rear drum brakes instead of rear disc brakes. Drum brake components consist of brake drums, shoes, wheel cylinders, and hardware including springs and self-adjusters. The brake shoes sit against the drum until the brakes are applied. Once applied, brake fluid pushes the wheel cylinders against the brake shoes, which in turn press against the brake drum and create the friction required to stop your vehicle. When you let off the brakes, the springs return the brake shoes back to their original position. This self-adjusting system helps keep the brake shoes in position when the brakes are not applied. As the brake shoes gradually become worn, the self-adjuster compensates for the worn area by adjusting the original position of the brake shoe so that it is closer to the brake drum. Because rear drum brakes serve an important role in slowing your vehicle, it is wise to get them repaired and replaced as necessary.'

            'desc' => 'During use, rear drum brakes create a serious amount of heat and friction that can degrade brake components over time. Grinding, screeching, or squealing noises signal worn brake shoes rubbing against the brake drum. Worn springs and an insufficiently lubricated self-adjuster can cause brake shoes to wear down quickly. Rapid and excessive wear may also point to problems with other components. Wheel cylinders that do not receive adequate brake fluid and worn springs that are unable to return brake shoes to their original position are both contributors to worn brake shoes and inevitable rear brake repairs. Because driving on worn rear drum brakes can endanger the life of yourself and other passengers, it is important to repair your brakes as needed. Our rear drum brake repair service can help. We cover rear drum brakes and accompanying components--like brake shoes, wheel cylinders, springs, and self-adjusters--to help ensure maximum drum brake performance.'
