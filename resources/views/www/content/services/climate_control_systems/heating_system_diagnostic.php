            'desc' => 'Your vehicle’s heating system absorbs excess engine heat through a mixture of water and antifreeze called coolant. Hoses carry the coolant from the engine to the radiator, where heat is expelled outside. The heating system circulates the heated coolant to the heater core in the dashboard, which directs the warm air into your vehicle’s interior compartment. This cycle depends on the heater hoses carrying the coolant from the engine to the heater core, where the heat can finally warm the inside of your vehicle. Heating system components include the heater fan, water pump, thermostat, heater hoses, and heater core. These components regulate the internal temperatures of the engine and vehicle cabin. The water pump pushes coolant to the engine block. Coolant flows from the cylinder heads to the heater core, where the heater fan directs the warm air outflow into the vehicle’s cabin. Once the heat is transferred from the coolant into the vehicle, the coolant returns to the water pump where it continues to circulate through the system. During a heating system service, our service staff will examine all working components to diagnosis and identify the problem.'

            'desc' => 'Heating system repairs may stem from mechanical and electrical issues. Stains under the passenger side of the dashboard are indicators of coolant leaks, which may be the result of a corroded heater core or cracks in the heater hoses. Sometimes the culprit of heater system problems is hard to pinpoint, which is why a heating system diagnostic may be necessary. During our heating system diagnostic, our service staff may inspect the heater core, blower motor, heater control valve, water pump, thermostat, and other components. We may also check your coolant levels, inspect your heater control valves, or troubleshoot your blower motor. By the end of a heating system diagnostic, our service staff will have isolated the heating system issue, repaired the component, and restored full functionality to the heating system. The next time your heating system breaks, just give us a call or contact us.'
