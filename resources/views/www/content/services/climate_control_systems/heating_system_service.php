            'desc' => 'In contrast to the cooling system, which removes heat from the engine, the heating system transfers the engine’s heat to the vehicle’s interior. Excess engine heat is absorbed by coolant, a mixture of water and antifreeze. Coolant is carried by the heater hoses from the engine to the radiator, which expels some of the heat into the atmosphere. The water pump pushes the coolant through the engine, cooling system, and heating system. The coolant travels to the heater core, located in your vehicle’s dashboard. There, the heater fan directs the rest of the warm air into the vehicle’s cabin. Once the coolant transfers heat into the vehicle, the coolant returns to the water pump where it continues to circulate through the system. The heating and cooling systems share a number of components, including the radiator, thermostat, and water pump. Other heating system components include the blower motor, heater control valve, heater core, heater fan, and heater hoses. These components work together to regulate temperatures in the engine and cabin compartment.'

            'desc' => 'Because the heating and cooling systems work in tandem, problems with the cooling system will affect the heating system. Low coolant levels, for example, can affect the heating system’s ability to warm your vehicle’s interior. Leaking coolant can be attributed to a damaged heater core, radiator, heater hose, or cooling system. Sweet smells coming from the air vents are a sign of a coolant leak. Other common issues that plague heating system components include a vacuum leak, heater valve failure, fan motor failure, heater core failure, or stuck thermostat. One of the most common causes of breakdowns is overheating, but heating system maintenance can help prevent this from happening. Consult your owner’s manual for recommended inspection intervals for the various heating system components, and be sure to seek out heating system repairs when necessary.'
