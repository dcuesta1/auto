            'desc' => 'A climate control system is a complex system that requires routine maintenance for increased seasonal performance and operation. A vehicle’s climate control system is comprised of multiple, smaller systems that work together to maintain a comfortable cabin environment. The climate control system is able to affect and regulate the internal temperature of a vehicle through a cycle of processes. Although the climate control system is primarily used to improve the comfort levels of both drivers and passengers, there are times over the course of the year when maintaining the ideal internal temperature becomes more than a matter of comfort. In severe weather conditions, maintaining the proper internal climate can actually factor into automotive safety. This is why it is important for you to seek climate control repairs at the first sign of trouble.'

In addition to regaining the comfortable cabin environment you enjoyed prior to your system’s problems, you can help ensure your safety as a driver. If you pay attention to the warning signs of an impending climate control system service, you may be able to prevent a broken system and subsequent safety concerns. In addition, your owner’s manual should provide recommended regular service intervals for climate control systems. Catching early warning signs and replacing or repairing climate control system components as necessary will help ensure your ability to control air outflow at all times.'
