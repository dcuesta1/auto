An overheated engine will lead to a breakdown, so radiator maintenance is very important to the overall functionality of your vehicle. The radiator sits at the front of the engine bay and is constructed with slim, hollow channels that run from the inlet tank to the outlet tank. Liquid coolant gets pumped through a sequence of tubes to the engine, where the liquid is warmed by the working engine. After the coolant passes through the engine, it makes its way to the radiator, which is constructed so that the flowing liquid is cooled by air passing through the radiator. The air is allowed in through the grill on the front of the car. Once the liquid is cooled down again, the coolant cycles back through the engine to absorb more heat in a continuous cycle to keep the engine working at optimal temperatures.'

If you think your radiator is malfunctioning, there are signs that might help you determine the appropriate time to schedule a service. One sign that your radiator isn’t working could be an elevated temperature gauge, which is an indication that your engine may be overheating. Another sign of a malfunctioning radiator is a green, yellow, or orange puddle of coolant under your car, which may point to a radiator leak. Radiators spring leaks due to corrosion.
