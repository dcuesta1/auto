Fortunately, the color of smoke can help a motorist diagnose the problem. Depending upon the issue, a diesel engine will emit black, blue, or white smoke. Black smoke usually indicates fuel combustion problems. This type of smoke can be caused by a low quality fuel, a dirty air filter, an overabundance of fuel amongst, or other, similar possibilities. Blue smoke is generally related to the vehicle’s oil. If there is oil in the combustion chamber, it can create blue smoke as it burns. In addition, blue smoke tends to appear when a driver first starts a diesel engine. Finally, white smoke often occurs when fuel is not being burned correctly. White smoke can be caused by worn injectors, damaged valves, and sticking piston rings.'
