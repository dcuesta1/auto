            'desc' => 'Diesel engines contain many components and small systems. Problems with systems and components can lead to hard starting and the need for a drivability diagnostic. When your diesel engine is hard to start, there are several things worth checking. First is the temperature. Diesel engines rely upon heat for the combustion process to occur. If the engine uses glow plugs, they may need to warm up before they can properly start the engine. Second is oil. The internal components of a diesel engine require a lubricant to perform at their best. Engine oil can prevent harmful friction from occurring and can remove dirt and other damaging debris. If a vehicle has a turbocharger, a dirty or low amount of lubrication may also harm the turbocharger and lead to drivability and hard starting issues. A bad battery, fuel supply, and fuel injectors may also lead to hard starting issues.'
