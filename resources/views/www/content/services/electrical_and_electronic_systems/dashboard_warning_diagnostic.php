Dashboard warning lights, or indicator lights, appear in the instrument cluster. Depending upon your vehicle, a warning may appear as either text, a symbol, or both. Generally, symbols are universal or very similar in appearance across different makes and models of vehicles. If you are unfamiliar with the symbol, you can consult your owners manual for its meaning. In many modern vehicles, dashboard warnings are color-coded. Yellow, orange, and red generally tell motorists to seek service shortly. When the text or symbol flashes, drivers should seek service immediately. Green and blue alerts also exist, and these are intended as informational pop-ups meant to inform you that something is in operation. Dashboard indicator lights exist for oil, tire pressure, lights, brakes, and more.'
