            'desc' => 'Many modern vehicles are equipped with a wide selection of interior and exterior lights for the convenience and safety of occupants. Glove box, rear view mirror, gauge panel, and overhead console lights are usually present in a vehicle’s cabin. On the outside of vehicles are headlights, license plate lights, and turning signal or “blinker” lights. During nighttime operation, interior and exterior lights are especially important. Headlights and cabin lights can illuminate the surrounding area, reducing risk of injury from tripping or stumbling. In addition, a vehicle’s lights can alert other motorists to the vehicle’s presence. This is important during emergencies when a vehicle may be parked off the roadside. In addition to their safety functions, lights are convenient. From dome lights and fog lights to headlights and tail lights, our staff has both the know-how and the correct tools to help solve your lighting problems.'
