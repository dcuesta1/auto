            'desc' => 'Since being introduced in 1914, power door locks have increased convenience and safety for drivers and passengers. Doors equipped with power locks may respond to multiple control methods. In many modern cars, a driver need only push a button on a vehicle’s remote key fob to lock or unlock all of its doors at once. In addition, this central locking system can often be switched on or off from buttons located in the front of the vehicle near the driver and passenger side. Vehicle locks are especially useful when multiple passengers need access to a vehicle at one time. They also provide safety, allowing drivers and passengers to quickly secure themselves inside the vehicle. For these reasons, power locks continue to serve as a standard feature in many vehicles today.'
