            'desc' => 'The sunroof is a horizontal panel, usually made of glass, located on a vehicle’s roof. Primarily, sunroofs provide personal enjoyment. They allow air into a vehicle on hot days and provide motorists with a view of the sky. While power sunroofs and side windows serve similar functions, power sunroofs are ultimately more complex than windows. Whereas windows rely upon a strict vertical motion, power sunroofs often need to move both vertically and horizontally. Depending upon the vehicle, a sunroof may be controlled manually or automatically. For electronically powered sunroofs, drivers often need only press or hold a button to open and close them. Some power sunroofs also operate from the turn of a key or the press of a button on the key fob. While convenient, sunroofs are not incapable of failure. Power sunroofs can become inoperable or leak over time. In such cases, it is advisable that drivers seek sunroof repair services.'
