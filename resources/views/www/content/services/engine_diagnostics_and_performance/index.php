Discrepancies in performance levels are reported through your vehicle’s computer system. Once the “check engine” or “service engine” light is displayed, your next step should be to seek out an engine diagnostic service or an engine tune-up. Engine diagnostics allow our staff to gather helpful information about the operating condition of your engine. The insights obtained during an engine diagnostic will determine the extent of suggested engine repairs. The most common diagnostic trouble codes are generated in response to malfunctions in the powertrain. Ultimately, regular engine tune-ups are necessary to optimize engine performance. A tune-up is also one of the most effective ways to prevent unexpected engine trouble. During an engine tune-up, our staff may replace the spark plugs, spark plug wires, air filter, fuel filter, and distributor cap and rotor in your vehicle. Our experts will also check emission levels, fuel lines, and belts and hoses. Engine diagnostics and regular engine tune-ups can help extend the life of your vehicle and improve the health of your engine.'

            'desc' => 'While regular engine maintenance will help ensure that your engine always performs at peak conditions, there are also signs you can look for that indicate an engine repair service is needed. The “check engine” or “service engine” light is a sure sign that your engine should be looked at by an expert sooner than later. Most of the time, your vehicle’s On-Board Diagnostics System will detect an engine issue and store the corresponding repair code, which can be accessed by a member of our service staff. Slow-cranking, rough idling, stalling, knocking, or pinging while accelerating are all signs that you should seek engine repairs or engine diagnostics to determine the full extent of your engine trouble. A decrease in gas mileage and detectable loss of power during acceleration are also signs of an impending engine tune-up or engine repair service. Engine warning lights help alert drivers to minor issues before they become major repairs. Be sure to follow up with our staff once your vehicle\'s On-Board Diagnostics System detects a problem with your engine.'
