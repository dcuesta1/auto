            'desc' => 'In the past, engine tune-ups were much more time consuming because they required a motorist to check a variety of parts. Engine tune-ups formerly included checking the distributor, cap, rotor, ignition contact points, condensers, carburetors, and more. Today, these items are generally no longer included in engine tune-ups because a vehicle’s electronic control unit controls the engine timing. While not as many parts need to be checked today, engine tune-ups still include the inspection of a variety of components. These include spark plugs and wires, oil and oil filters, and fuel filters. Regular tune-ups will ensure your engine is running efficiently and reliably. Engine tune-ups can help prevent breakdowns and extend the life of an automobile. A well-tuned engine will help keep a vehicle operating at maximum performance levels, which is why routine maintenance is so important.'

            'desc' => 'During a tune-up, our service staff will check your spark plugs, which are responsible for igniting the gasoline and air mixture that fuels your engine. We can also check your spark plug wires, which transfer voltage created by your spark plug. Old wires can burn out and cause a misfire. We will check the condition of your fuel filters, which help stop debris from reaching your engine. A clogged fuel filter will lead to poor acceleration and poor engine performance. Similarly, we can look at your air filter, which prevents debris from entering the combustion engine. Restricted airflow makes your engine work harder and causes your vehicle to lose horsepower. During our tune-up, we can ensure optimal performance of these parts and more. Please adhere to your owner’s manual for recommended service intervals, and contact us when your engine is ready for a tune-up.'
