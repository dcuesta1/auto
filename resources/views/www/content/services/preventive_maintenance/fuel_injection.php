            'desc' => 'During a fuel injection, your vehicle’s fuel injectors are checked. Located in the intake manifold of the engine, fuel injectors use small nozzles to spray a mist of fuel that your engine can burn. Fuel injectors work with your throttle valve, which lets air into the engine whenever you use the gas pedal. When the valve opens, fuel injectors release the fuel mist so it mixes with the air. This fuel and air combination then enters the combustion chamber and helps your vehicle run. Over time, fuel injectors can become dirty. Clogged injectors can negatively affect your vehicle’s performance, leading to poor gas mileage and dirty exhaust emissions. Short trips make it especially easy for dirt and grime to build up inside the fuel injector nozzles. Because a healthy fuel injection system is important for overall vehicle maintenance, we advise you to keep watch over your fuel injectors and have them serviced as needed.'
