The battery, an essential component that works particularly hard during the winter months, may be tested and its age considered. If snow tires are equipped on your vehicle, a spring checkup is a good time to replace them with summer tires. In addition, the tread depth and tire pressure of summer tires may be looked at because they can affect gas mileage. Belts and hoses may also be checked to make sure they are intact and sturdy. Potholes usually become more pronounced after winter, so it is important to see if the shocks and struts are in healthy condition as well. From the starting and charging system to the transmission fluid and antifreeze levels, there is much to review during a spring inspection. However, a checkup can ultimately help keep your vehicle safe and save you money in the long run.'
