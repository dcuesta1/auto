            'desc' => 'Wiper blades are responsible for helping drivers travel safely in inclement weather. In bad weather conditions like downpours, wiper blades can be activated to help keep a driver’s field of vision clear. Many vehicles have a single pair of wiper blades located on the front windshield, but some vehicles also contain a wiper blade on the rear windshield. Because they are located on the outside of your vehicle, wiper blades are prone to wear and will require replacements in time. Even if they are not heavily used, the blades should be replaced regularly because the material they are made of has its own lifespan. Generally, it is recommended that wiper blades be replaced every 6,000 miles or every six months. However, it is worth noting that surrounding weather conditions may alter the lifespan of the blades, so it is recommended that all drivers inquire about the best time to replace their specific wiper blades.'
