The starting system consists of the battery, a starter motor, and a starter solenoid responsible for starting the engine, while the charging system consists of an alternator and voltage regulator. The charging system is responsible for routing energy throughout the entire electrical process while sustaining the battery’s charge. The battery supplies the electric power necessary to start the vehicle. This process starts when you turn the ignition. Then, the starting system sends power from the battery to the starter solenoid to the starter motor, which turns the engine in order to begin the internal combustion process. The alternator powers the other electrical components in your vehicle while the regulator controls the voltage supplied to each component. The regulator also ensures that the alternator maintains the battery’s charge so that the entire cycle can continue.'

Because the battery is required for the electrical charge needed to start the rest of the electrical system, a weak or dead battery can also prevent your car from starting. If a jump start refuses to revive your battery and the starting system, our staff may need to take a closer look at the other components of the starting and charging system to determine whether or not you need a starter replacement or an alternator replacement. All components within your vehicle’s starting and charging system are necessary to ensure proper working order, and one bad link between them can render the entire electrical process useless. If you experience problems with starting your vehicle or maintaining its power even after trying a jump start, then allow our service staff to perform a starting and charging system check on your vehicle today.'
