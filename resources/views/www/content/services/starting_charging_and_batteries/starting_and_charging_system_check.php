The starting system involves a number of parts, including the ignition switch, starter, and flywheel. Using energy from the battery, the starter uses a gear to interact with the engine. Without a starter, an engine would be inoperable. The charging system, which includes the battery, alternator, and voltage regulator, play an equally important role. The battery is needed to send electricity to the starter. The alternator powers all the electrical components by generating electrical currents, and the voltage regulator ensures that the output of the alternator does not over- or under-charge the components dependent on the electrical current. Together, the starting and charging systems interact with one-another to keep a vehicle operating for its driver.'
