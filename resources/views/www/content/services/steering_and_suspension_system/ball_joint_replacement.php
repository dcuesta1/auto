            'desc' => 'The suspension system allows your tires to maintain constant contact with the road, especially on uneven surfaces like bumps and potholes. Ball joints are ball-and-socket joints located between the control arm and the steering knuckle. Ball joints act as the pivot point between the wheels and the rest of the suspension system. They are designed to allow for movement in two planes at once while providing ease of rotation in those planes. They allow a vehicle’s suspension system to move up or down while the wheels turn left or right. Vehicles with shocks have upper and lower ball joints, while many vehicles with struts have only lower ball joints. Some ball joints are load-bearing and will wear faster than normal ball joints. As an important suspension component, ball joints are designed to experience wear and tear, often in the form of friction. Like all suspension system components, ball joints have a maintenance schedule that can help prevent unexpected repairs or replacements.'

            'desc' => 'Upper and lower ball joints are designed to fit snugly inside a lubricated casing. If the casing loses lubrication, dries out, or the linkage becomes loose, wheel alignment may be affected. A loose ball joint can also result in suspension noise and uneven tire wear. Because ball joints act as the link between the wheels and other suspension components, a bad joint can conflict with normal steering capabilities. In extreme cases, a worn ball joint that fails may fall out of its casing and cause a collapse of the suspension system. Clunking sounds, poor handling, and unnatural pulling are all signs of bad ball joints. In some cases, ball joints may require replacements. If you plan on avoiding a ball joint failure, be sure to consult your owner’s manual for the maximum allowable wear on your suspension system’s ball joints. Our replacement ball joints will restore full functionality to your suspension system.'
