            'desc' => 'Regardless of the type of steering system in your vehicle, you use inner and outer tie rods. As an important part of your vehicle’s steering and suspension system, tie rods act as the link between your vehicle’s steering system and the steering arm, which is attached to the steering wheel. When you turn the steering wheel, the steering arm moves the front wheels through the steering system. The inner and outer tie rods connect to the steering arm in order to move the wheels of your vehicle. In the common rack-and-pinion steering system, the inner tie rods connect to the steering rack while the outer tie rods connect to the steering arms. The tie rods make steering and turning possible by moving your wheels in the desired direction. Without properly functioning tie rods, the steering mechanism would no longer operate as intended. Because inner and outer tie rods play such a significant role, replacing tie rods as necessary is important for overall vehicle maintenance.'

            'desc' => 'Difficult, erratic, and unexpected steering are signs that your tie rods—inner, outer, or both—might need to be replaced. One indication that your tie rods may be loose is excessive and uneven tire wear. Vibrations and clunking noises emanating from the front of your vehicle are another sign. Steering that pulls or refuses to return to center are also signals that your inner and outer tie rods should be checked and possibly replaced by a member of our service staff. Wheels out of alignment may be signs of bad inner or outer tie rods. As an outer tie rod fails, the toe changes direction and the steering begins to pull. Clicking or grinding noise under your front wheels are other signs of bad tie rods. If you experience any warning signs of a malfunctioning tie rod, give us a call or contact us online, and allow our service staff to determine if your steering system requires tie rod replacements.'
