            'desc' => 'The primary function of your vehicle’s suspension system is to provide structural support while maintaining comfortable riding conditions. The suspension system helps your vehicle’s tires maintain firm contact on the road at all times by compensating for bumps, potholes, and sudden undulations. Suspension system components like coil springs, leaf springs, torsion bars, shocks, and struts all help to absorb bounce, shock, and unexpected motion from the surface of the road. Without a fully functioning suspension system, your vehicle will be harder to control. Because regular wear and tear takes its toll on your suspension system, the scheduling of routine repairs and an understanding of the signs of an impending service are an important part of suspension system maintenance. For example, experiencing unusual movements over bumps or through turns are signs that your suspension system should be inspected by a staff of professionals. When you suspect suspension system problems, please give us a call or contact us.'

            'desc' => 'Knowing how to identify steering and suspension issues will help you determine when to schedule an inspection. Over time, the components of your suspension system, like coil springs, shock absorbers, struts, shocks, tie rods, ball joints, and sway bar links, can weaken and malfunction, thereby decreasing your ability to maintain control of your vehicle. Signs of an impending suspension inspection include leaking shocks or struts. Nose-dives when braking and bottoming out during bumps are also signs of a problem with your vehicle’s suspension system. If you begin to experience driving irregularities like bouncing, swaying, or unusual stiffness, contact us today for an inspection of your steering and suspension system. Besides being aware of the signs and symptoms of a worn suspension system, be sure to consult your owner’s manual when determining maintenance schedules and intervals for inspections of your vehicle’s suspension system.'
