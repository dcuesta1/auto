            'desc' => 'In a manual transmission, the responsibility of the clutch is to engage and disengage the transmission from the engine. A clutch in a manual transmission allows the engine to continue turning even when the vehicle is stopped. In an automatic transmission, this process is regulated by the torque converter and transmission fluid. The clutch operates two shafts, one in the transmission and the other in the engine, and uses friction to keep the transmission connected to the engine. If the clutch is engaged, the pressure plate pushes against a flywheel and joins the transmission to the engine. If the clutch is disengaged, the pressure plate pulls away from the flywheel, separating the transmission from the engine. The clutch makes switching gears possible. Some transmissions use hydraulic clutches while others use cable clutches. In both cases, routine clutch maintenance is required to keep all moving components operating efficiently. If you are concerned about the functionality of your clutch, be sure to contact us about a service.'

            'desc' => 'A slipping or sticking clutch are both signs that you should have your clutch inspected. If your clutch slips, the friction material on the clutch disc may have worn away, which will loosen the contact between the disc and the flywheel. When a clutch sticks, the clutch fails to release all the way, and leaves the engine in limited contact with the transmission. This can create grinding noises and an inability to switch between gears. Too much free play and an overly stiff clutch are signs of an impending clutch inspection or adjustment. Most clutch adjustments concerning a hydraulic clutch involve examining, draining, and refilling the fluid reservoirs. In a clutch check and adjustment involving a cable driven clutch, our service staff will check the cable on the release arm, and make the necessary adjustments on the cables and hardware in your vehicle’s clutch mechanism. Neglecting a clutch adjustment or inspection when warning signs arise can cause serious damage to your engine and transmission.'
