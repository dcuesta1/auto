The transmission connects to the engine and supplies power to the wheels, but this linkage cannot be constant, since a vehicle is not always moving. In a manual transmission, the clutch is used to engage and disengage the transmission and the engine. The clutch operates two shafts: one shaft connects to the transmission and the other connects to the engine. Clutches use friction to keep the transmission connected to the engine. When the clutch is disengaged, the pressure plate pulls away from the flywheel and separates the transmission from the engine. When the clutch is engaged, a pressure plate pushes against a flywheel and joins the transmission to the engine. In a manual transmission, a clutch allows your engine to continue spinning even when the vehicle is stopped. Switching between gears in a vehicle with a manual transmission is made possible by operating the clutch.'

            'desc' => 'Each time you press down on the clutch, the pressure plate pushes against a flywheel, joins the transmission to the engine, and enables gears to be changed. Over time, the friction accompanying this repetitive action will wear down the clutch, pressure plate, flywheel, and accompanying gears and bearings. Owners of vehicles with manual transmissions should always use their clutch with care and keep up with clutch maintenance. A clutch check can help extend the life of your clutch. If your vehicle’s clutch ever fails, the transmission will not be able to transfer power from the engine to the wheels. If you still experience grinding and rumbling noises after components have been replaced and a clutch adjustment has been made, a clutch replacement will be required to restore full operation to your transmission and your vehicle.'
