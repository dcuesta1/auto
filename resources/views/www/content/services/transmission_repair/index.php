The “check engine” or “service engine” light is a sure sign that your engine should be looked at by an expert sooner than later. Most of the time, your vehicle’s On-Board Diagnostics System will detect an engine issue and store the corresponding repair code, which can be accessed by a member of our service staff. Slow-cranking, rough idling, stalling, knocking, or pinging while accelerating are all signs that you should seek engine repairs or engine diagnostics to determine the full extent of your engine trouble. A decrease in gas mileage and detectable loss of power during acceleration are also signs of an impending engine tune-up or engine repair service. Engine warning lights help alert drivers to minor issues before they become major repairs. Be sure to follow up with our staff once your vehicle’s On-Board Diagnostics System detects a problem with your engine.'
