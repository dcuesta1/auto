            'desc' => 'The transmission is the link between the engine and the wheels of your vehicle. Whether you drive a manual, automatic, or semi-automatic vehicle, the transmission plays a crucial role in the performance and reliability of your vehicle. The transmission keeps engine output matched with speed and load conditions. Because engines operate at high rotational speeds, the transmission reduces engine output speed and transmits torque through the differential, driveshaft, and wheels. As engine speed varies, the transmission switches between the gears that influence the amount of torque applied to the wheels. Transmission fluid performs a variety of duties, depending on the type of transmission. Transmission fluid acts as a cooling agent and protects the transmission by lubricating the internal gears and preventing corrosion and rust. In a manual transmission, clutches and gear shifts provide pressure and force—like engagement and disengagement—while in an automatic transmission, transmission fluid provides these same operational functions of force and pressure.'

            'desc' => 'A faulty transmission can negatively affect your vehicle’s performance. Symptoms of an impending transmission service include grinding gears, difficulty shifting, slipping out of gear, bucking, and hesitation. Even if your transmission is in neutral, excessive noise is a sign of transmission problems. In a manual transmission, a dragging clutch, or a clutch failing to disengage from the flywheel, is another sign of transmission issues. When this occurs, the clutch continues to spin with your vehicle’s engine, and a grinding noise will occur. A burning smell sifting through the air vents is a sign of burning transmission fluid and an overheating transmission. Things that can negatively impact the life of your transmission include extreme driving habits, and excessive loads or heavy towing habits. Because of the necessary pressure and force provided by transmission fluid in automatic transmissions, old, dirty, and unchanged transmission fluid can cause performance issues. Regular transmission maintenance as indicated by your vehicle’s manufacturer can help prevent transmission problems, but if you experience any of the above warning signs of transmission trouble, contact us today about transmission repair.'
