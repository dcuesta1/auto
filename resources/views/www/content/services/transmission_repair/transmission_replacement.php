Essentially, the transmission converts the RPMs of the engine into torque, which is transferred to the drive wheels of the vehicle. The transmission switches between a range of speeds by shifting gears as a vehicle speeds up and slows down. Transmission fluid acts as a cooling agent. This fluid lubricates the internal gears and prevents corrosion and rust while the transmission filter helps to remove contaminants from the fluid. The components inside manual and automatic transmissions may differ, but routine maintenance is all about keeping internal components moving and operating as they should. When the life of your transmission comes to an end, our service staff will replace your manual or automatic transmission with a quality aftermarket transmission that matches or exceeds the performance standards of the originally equipped transmission.'

            'desc' => 'Transmission trouble is a serious concern in overall car maintenance. Taking action after hearing irregular sounds from your transmission can help prevent major transmission repairs, although there are occasions when a transmission replacement is the only option. Grinding and crunching sounds will alert you to issues with internal gears. Even if your transmission is in neutral, abnormal noise is a sign that you should replace internal transmission components like bearings, gears, shafts, and dirty or stale transmission fluid. Regardless of whether your vehicle has an automatic or manual transmission, slipping out of gear is another sign of transmission trouble. The smell of burning fluid coming from your air vents will alert you to an overheating transmission. If a breakdown occurs, be sure to contact us by phone for a transmission replacement.'
